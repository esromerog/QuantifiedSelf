      "description": "The Emotiv is an electroencephalography (EEG) headset that reads brain signals and sends them into a computer. This is a consumer-grade device generally used for research outside of laboratories and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Emotiv not only acquires the raw signals, but it also provides meaningful metrics derived from the signal. It also has motion data to track head movement.",
